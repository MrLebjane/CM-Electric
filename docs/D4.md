## 1. Problem Statement & Proposed Solution
####   1.1 Problem Statement:
The executives of the company are realizing that the company is continuing to expand and with that they will need to have a more efficient way of reaching and interacting with their customers.

####   1.2 Proposed Solution:
Create the system where client will be able to book an appointment for the service they need.
When the clients book an appointment they should be able to specify an issue encountered that needs to be resolved by the 
company and state whether is it for a commercial or residential property.
