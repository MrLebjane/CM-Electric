## 1. Problem Statement & Proposed Solution
####   1.1 Problem Statement:
The executives of the company are realizing that the company is continuing to expand and with that they will need to have a more efficient way of reaching and interacting with their customers. Their day to day business processes are also starting to become harder to manage due to the workload.The company may also face challenges in collecting and analyzing customer feedback effectively, resulting in missed opportunities to understand customer needs, preferences, and pain points, leading to a disconnect between the company and its customers.


####   1.2 Proposed Solution:
Create the system where client will be able to book an appointment for the service they need.
When the clients book an appointment they should be able to specify an issue encountered that needs to be resolved by the 
company and state whether is it for a commercial or residential property. Due to the increase in company's daily workload, the system will also allow the manager to delegate the work to employees (techniacians) based on the customer's demands, therefore, the employees will be able to monitor and manage their work schedule easier, as a result, they will be able to attend to customer's demand in no time. 
        Benefits:
 - The company will be easily accessed : The customers will be able to access the company easily rather than 
              being referred by someone who knows the company when they are in need of electrical services.
 - The company will be able to track how they are doing : The company will be able to see how much profit   they made based of the number of appointments they attend to. 
- Saving money and time (for client): The clients will be able to save their time and money, because they       won't  be a need to go to the company physically.
 - The company will be able to ensure whether their technicians completed all aspects of each job or not : The   company will track their technicians' on whether they went to the right place or not. The technicians will log each job they have completed.
